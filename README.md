						My name is Rafieq Roslan, an IT bachelor student majored in Intelligent Systems Engineering. This project developed just for Soding interview tasks. So, I am using Admin LTE layout as the theme and this website is using Laravel Framework. Firstly, import soding.sql to your mysql database. Then, open your terminal at this root file and type "php artisan serve". Copy the address given and paste on your browser. So now, click on sidebar 'CRUD' for do 'crud-ing' to tasks that I named it as 'Product'. That's all. Thank You. :)
